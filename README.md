# A.R.C.H. --> Allyship Resources for Change and Harmony
## Why this project?
Through the development of this project, our primary goal is to empower marginalized groups in the workplace and foster an inclusive environment where individuals can freely express their authentic selves. We are dedicated to educating people on the importance of respecting diverse perspectives within the workplace and offering valuable resources to facilitate this understanding.
## Intended Outcome
The specific intended outcome for this project would be to equip people with the knowledge to become better educated on topics surrounding social issues, so that they be able to better help under-represented communities in various professional settings. We would track this by creating performance metric assessments that would test users knowledge before and after going through different knowledge sections.
